# WordScramble
This is a word scramble game where you get points based on what words you can spell out of a root word. This app was part of my SwiftUI course with Paul Hudson.

In this app my challenges were:

Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.

Add a toolbar button that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.

Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the playerâ€™s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.
